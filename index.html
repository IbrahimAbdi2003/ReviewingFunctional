        Dinosaur train
        
        [Verse 1]
        Once upon a time, there was a mom
        Her name was Mrs. Pteranadon
        Sitting on her nest she heard scratching and said
        "Oh boy, my eggs are hatching"
        One by one her kids popped free
        Baby Pteranadons, one two three
        "I'll name you Tiny, Shiny, and Don"
        But Tiny said "Wait, there's one more, Mom"
        The last little baby was a different size
        With teeth, a tail, and big green eyes
        He didn't look anything like the rest
        "What am I doing in a Pteranodon nest?"
        But dear old Mrs. Pteranodon said
        "This is your family and I'm your mom
        We may be different, but we're all creatures
        All dinosaurs have different features
        Come on Buddy, we'll take a vacation
        I'll get us a ticket at Pteranadon station
        We'll travel the word in sunshine and rain
        And meet all the species on the..."
        [Chorus]
        Dinosaur train! (Dinosaur train)
        Dinosaur train! (Dinosaur train)
        We're gonna ride (Ride, ride, ride, ride)
        The dinosaur train!</p>
